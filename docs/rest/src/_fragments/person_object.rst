Id
    A **string** that the host can use, in the context of the provider, to uniquely identify the user.

    ..  note:: When this is generated by the WOPI client, it will be the UserId property from :ref:`CheckFileInfo`.  When this comes from the :ref:`SearchPeople` API, it will be whatever the host returns.

    ..  note:: When this is generated by the WOPI client, it will be the concatenation of "wopi_" + the HostName property from :ref:`CheckFileInfo`.  When this comes from the :ref:`SearchPeople` API, it will be whatever the host returns.
