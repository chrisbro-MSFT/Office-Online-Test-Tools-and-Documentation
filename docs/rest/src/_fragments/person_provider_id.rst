Id
    A **string** that the host can use, in the context of the provider, to uniquely identify the user.

    ..  note::
        When this is generated by the WOPI client, it will be the UserId property from :ref:`CheckFileInfo`.
        When this comes from the :ref:`SearchPeople` API, it will be whatever the host returns.
        Id may be optional or required, depending on the context.

Provider
    A **string** giving the context in which the Id can be used to identify the user.

    ..  note::
        When this is generated by the WOPI client, it will be the concatenation of "wopi-" + the HostName property from :ref:`CheckFileInfo`.
        When this comes from the :ref:`SearchPeople` API, it will be whatever the host returns.
        Provider may be optional or required, depending on the context.
